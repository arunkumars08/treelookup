# treelookup
This helps you to find the number down the tree using BFS methodology, asynchronously


Steps to run the application.

1. Clone the contents like git clone https://github.com/arunkumars08/treelookup.git
2. Navigate into treelookup folder
3. Open index.html in any browser
4. Type any number to search in the search box found in the page
5. It shows the navigation route/ traversal route if the number is present
    If not, it shows an error message saying it is not found.
    
Extras:

1. Improve the feature by adding recent searched feature
2. Use the same feature to implement dynamic programming to enable faster rendering of results instead of going through the traversal again, for the numbers which are indexed.
